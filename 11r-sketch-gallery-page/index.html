  <p1>
    Optimus prime is one of the most impressive <br>
    science fiction character of all time. Being <br>
    the leader of "Autobots", the justice side of <br>
    the animation series "Transformers",he can<br>
    transform into a truck. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
  </p1>

  <p2>
    Althought the orginal color of optimus prime <br>
    is red and blue, there are other characters <br>
    in the series look like him with different <br>
    color. This project aims to show how I think <br>
    the Optimus prime transforms <br>
    <br>
    By pressing the mouse, Optimus will transform <br>
    into truck mode, and by pressing the key "t", <br>
    he will transform back. <br>
